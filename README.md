# BULB-ON-OFF
ðŸŒŸ Just finished my first JavaScript project! ðŸ’¡ðŸ”Œ  I'm thrilled to share my "Bulb On-Off" creation, a small yet significant step in my coding journey. With a single click, you can illuminate and extinguish the bulb, thanks to JavaScript magic. As a beginner, I'm proud of this hands-on learning experience. #JavaScript #WebDevelopment #BeginnerCoder
